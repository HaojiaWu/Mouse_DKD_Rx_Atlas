# Mouse-Diabetic-Kidney-Disease-Single-Cell-Atlas
This repository documented the scripts to generate the data for our manuscript entitled ***Mapping the Single Cell Transcriptomic Response of Murine Diabetic Kidney Disease to Therapies***. <link> <br>
The raw and processed data have been deposited on Gene Expression Omnibus (**GSE184652**). A searchable database, including gene expression in all kidney cell types, glomerular cell types, and PCT cell types is available at our Kidney Interactive Transcriptomics (K.I.T.) website: http://humphreyslab.com/SingleCell/.
