## Differential gene analysis
We used the Seurat FindMarkers function to compute the differential genes for each pair-wise comparison (e.g. Disease versus healthy, treatment versus non-treatment). This directory contains scripts to loop over all kidney cell types using the same parameters. Input file is a complete Seurat object that contains all groups to be compared.
