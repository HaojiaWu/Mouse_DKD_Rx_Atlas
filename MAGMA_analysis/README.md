# Causative disease celltypes for the kidney disease traits with MAGMA
We followed the codes provided by Bryois et al (https://github.com/jbryois/scRNA_disease) to identify the causative disease cell types for the kidney disease traits.
MAGMA was installed according to the instructions: https://ctg.cncr.nl/software/magma. The auxiliary files for magma were downloaded from the MAGMA page. The summary stats for kidney disease traits CKD, eGFR, BUN and UCAR were downloaded from the CKDGen Consortium Data website (https://ckdgen.imbi.uni-freiburg.de)<br>
