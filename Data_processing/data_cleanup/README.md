## This is a pipeline for filtering the cells and genes, removing cell doublets, and clustering on each individual sample.
This pipeline uses Seurat for QC, and DoubletFinder to remove doublets.
The input file is the hdf5 file generated by the Cellbender pipeline. This pipeline will output a number of plots for initial QC checkup, including:
1. Gene/transcripts/mito counts, tSNE/UMAP, kidney cell type marker expression before DoubletFinder.
2. Doublets indentified by DoubletFinder
3. Gene/transcripts/mito counts, tSNE/UMAP, kidney cell type marker expression after DoubletFinder. <br/>
Usage: Rscript --vanilla cleanup_pipe.R -r path_to_input_hdf -o outdir -n sampleID
```R
Rscript --vanilla cleanup_pipe.R -r path_to_hdf -o outdir -n sampleID
